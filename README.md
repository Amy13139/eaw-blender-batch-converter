# EaW-Blender-Batch-Converter: No Blender Branch
This branch is identical to the master branch, except that it does not contain any of the files included with Blender 2.79. This branch should be downloaded over the main branch if you already have Blender 2.79, or if you want to use some of the features that I stripped from the Blender version on the main branch.
